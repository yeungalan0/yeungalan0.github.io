# My Webpage

This is the code used to create my personal webpage in which I post the current projects I'm working on, my resume, a brief about me, and life lessons in general. I hope you like it!

# Credits

The themes used came from Amey Jadiye's [Code Inventory](https://github.com/codeinventory/codeinventory.github.io) and originally from Hossain Faysal's [Notepad](https://github.com/hmfaysal/Notepad). It is a beautiful theme, and I hope to add more to it in time to make it more unique to me.

Thanks for looking!
