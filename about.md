Hi there!

My name is Alan Yeung, and I'm a Computer Science and Economics major at Colorado College. My research interests include computer vision and artificial intelligence. I would love to, one day, work on computer driven cars. Creating a network of wirelessly connected cars could save millions of lives and millions of hours. Also, on the economics side I'm interested in investments. Specifically I want to research human investment decisions and  prediction. My hobbies include fly fishing, texas hold'em poker, hiking, running, tennis, and puzzles. If you want to know more about me or want to chat about something interesting feel free to send me an [email](mailto:yeungalan0@gmail.com). Also if you couldn't tell by the snow, I love the holidays!
