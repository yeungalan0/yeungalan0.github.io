Hello All,

I've been meaning to compile a list of the best personal finance readings I've encountered thus far, both for personal reference and to give out to those interested. I expect to update this list as the years go by, but without further ado, this is my list of the best readings on personal finance:

* A Random Walk Down Wallstreet
  - This is an all around AMAZING book. The general lesson is simple, almost all "expert" stock pickers do not provide higher returns than the general market when costs are taken into accound. Thus it is in the best interest of most people to buy the market, which can be done by purchasing a low cost index fund that models the general market trends (such as the S & P 500).
