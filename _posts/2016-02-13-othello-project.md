![Alt text](/images/othello.png "Othello Bot in action")

For this project, I created an Othello bot in java for a class project that uses alpha-beta pruning and heuristics to play Othello strategically.

The bot, AlphaBetaBot3, won the class competition (AI 2015), and after I played it against several other online bots (and won) I decided it was worth putting it on GitHub and seeing if anyone could beat it, after all it is a champion bot. Don't take my word for it though, play it and find out! ;)

My professor (Matthew Whitehead) wrote the majority of the (great) framework code for this project. I wrote the alpha-beta pruning algorithm as well as the heuristic code. Additionally, I wrote the event handling so that a mouse click on the jframe would cause a corresponding move.

[Check out the code!](https://github.com/yeungalan0/Othello)

Enjoy!
