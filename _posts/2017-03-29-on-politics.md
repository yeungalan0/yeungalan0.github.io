I've been thinking a lot about politics recently, after being bombarded with it on every media outlet for months, it was a bit difficult for me not to think about it. Most mainstream media is strongly to the left, abortion is a choice, guns are bad, and racism, sexism, transism, and homophobia are running amock in society. On the depths of the internet however, the right is strong and bathing in power. Most right ideals seem to align the ideas that abortion is bad, guns are necessary, and immigrants are going to throw the US into chaos with terrorism and job stealing. Each party holds strongly opposing viewpoints, so which one is right?

Hi All,

I just wanted to share a quick life lesson(s).

First, if you don't use version contol, shame on you. Please do it now! It will save you thousands (millions?) of headaches. I would highly suggest [learning Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) and then integrating it with [Github](https://github.com/)!

Next, if you do use version control, yay! You'll have less headaches in life (I guarantee it). However, even with version control problems will still happen, so I offer you this advice, commit code early and commit code often. You never know when a small change you made in your _config.yml file will break your webpage hours later because Jekyll can't automatically update config file changes, and you bang your head on the table reverting all your changes in several different files trying to find the problem (just a hypothetical example).

# So in summary: #
	
	1. Get and use a version control system!
	2. Commit code early and commit often!
